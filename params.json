A few of the most common are\r\ndescribed here:\r\n\r\n####$.ku4workerClient.thread()\r\nThe ku4workerClient.thread method will spawn new ku4workerClient threads using the ku4js-workers-thread.js file or another\r\nreceiver file specified using the ku4workerClient threadPath method. Note that the threadPath method sets one global path.\r\nThis is often fine as many projects will have one receiver file that contain all necessary assets for any thread spawning\r\n_(See comments in the ku4js-workers-thread.js file)_. By default this path is set to the ku4js-workers-thread.js file that\r\nshould be in the same directory as the ku4js-workers.js file. This is the same as the following set up:\r\n\r\n```javascript\r\n$.ku4workerClient.threadPath(\"ku4js-thread-path.js\");\r\nvar threadUsingThreadPath = $.ku4workerClient.thread();\r\n```\r\n\r\n####$.ku4workerClient(PATH)\r\nFor those projects that require multiple ku4workerReceivers you can create the ku4workerClients by instatiating new\r\ninstances using the constructor method and passing the receiver path to the constructor. This means of creating a\r\nku4workerClient allows the developer to create various types of potential threads that, when spawned, may contain\r\ndifferent assets. Example:\r\n\r\n```javascript\r\nvar thread1 = $.ku4workerClient(\"myReceiverPath\"),\r\n    thread2 = $.ku4workerClient(\"myOtherReceiverPath\");\r\n\r\nthread1.invoke(\"new myClass\", [], \"myMethod\");\r\nthread2.invoke(\"new otherClass\", [\"myConstructors\"], [\r\n    {\"fluentMethod1\": [\"args\"]},\r\n    {\"fluentMethod2\": [\"arg1\", \"arg2\"]},\r\n    \"toString\"\r\n]);\r\n```\r\n\r\n##ku4workerReceiver\r\n| API | Return | Description |\r\n| --- | --- | --- |\r\n| execute | void | This method is called by the ku4js-workers-thread file and needed be called otherwise. |\r\n\r\n###ku4workerReceiver Notes:\r\nEach ku4worker set up requires a ku4workerReceiver. These receivers are called from within the ku4js-workers-thread.js\r\nfile. It is expected that any and all threads will leverage _the_ or a modified copy of _the_ ku4js-workers-thread.js\r\nfile. More information on this file can be found in the comments within the file itself and in the example project\r\nfound in the /example directory.","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
